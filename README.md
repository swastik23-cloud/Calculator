I make calculator using python
A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
Basic calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication and division mathematical calculations.
The purpose of a calculator is to do correct calculations, and to do so efficiently. 
It is clear that a calculator should relieve the user of the need to do mental operations and of the need to rely on paper, so far as possible.
This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem. 
Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
